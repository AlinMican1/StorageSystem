# StorageSystem
SQL-Based Rating and Sales Management System
This repository contains a SQL-based system designed to manage ratings, sales, customer information, and product details. The core functionality is implemented using SQL, enabling efficient data storage and retrieval.

# Database Creation and Structure
The createdb.sql script included in this repository sets up the initial database with predefined constraints. It ensures that values adhering to specified rules can be saved into the database. Executing this script will create the necessary tables, relationships, and constraints.

# Testing Data Insertion
To verify that values of the correct types can be successfully inserted into the tables, the insert.sql script serves as a test case. By executing this script, you can simulate the insertion of sample data into the respective tables. This process ensures the integrity of the database and validates that the system can handle different types of data effectively.

# Querying Data
The system includes various queries to retrieve specific information from the database based on user requirements. These queries are designed to provide flexibility in selecting relevant data based on user-defined criteria. By utilizing the appropriate query syntax, you can retrieve ratings, sales records, customer details, and product information as per your specific needs.
